# Attention-Based Speech Recognition
##### [![link to repo](/files/source.jpg)](https://github.com/rhopatel/IDL-hw4) Nov 2022 - Dec 2022 

- Built an end-to-end speech recognition system using attention mechanisms (from the [Listen, Attend and Spell paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.01211v2.pdf)), implementing the transformer architecture using NumPy and PyTorch to enable high-accuracy speech transcription on the LibriSpeech dataset

- Acheived a final (private score) Levenshtein distance of 12.23 on Kaggle 

- Part of the final homework for Introduction to Deep Learning (11-485)
