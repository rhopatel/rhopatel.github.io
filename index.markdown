- I'm an senior undergrad double-majoring in Computational Neuroscience and Statistics & Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University

- Last fall, I explored the field of DL through the course 11-485/685 Intro to Deep Learning

- Check out my [projects](https://rhopatel.github.io/projects/) and some relevant [courses](https://rhopatel.github.io/coursework) from my last few years @ CMU

- I'm graduating in Spring 2023 and currently searching for Bioinformatics, Data Science, and Machine Learning opportunities, particularly in biotech/healthcare
